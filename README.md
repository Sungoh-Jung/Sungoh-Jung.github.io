# My First Blog: Sungoh-Jung.github.io

hello. I am a college student who has just started studying development. So, I haven't done any other projects until now. However, I will have a lot of development experience in the future and post whenever I have time it on my blog.

# I'm trying to write in English as much as I can.

You can infer that I am Korean just by looking at my name. I think English is very important in the field of development. In this reason, I am trying to write the blog in English as much as possible even though I am not good at English.

I am relying on a translator now, but I want to be able to write my thoughts without the help of a translator even if I am not good at it someday. Then I will get used to English slowly someday?
