## "Do it! 알고리즘 코딩테스트 자바 편"

- "구간 합 구하기(문제 003, 44p~46p)(Baekjoon Online Judge: 11659번)"
- "구간 합 구하기2(문제 004, 47p~51p)(Baekjoon Online Judge: 11660번)"
- "나머지 합 구하기(문제 005, 52p~55p)(Baekjoon Online Judge: 10986번)"
- I studied these problems with the book
- I couldn't solve "나머지 합 구하기". when I test my code through Baekjoon Online Judge, it said ArrayIndexOutofBounds excepion. However, I couldn't find why this excepion occurs.
